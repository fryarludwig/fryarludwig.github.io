    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My name is Kenny and I’m a Software Developer. From my first “Hello World” in 2008,
      I’ve been coding academically, professional, and as a hobby. My formal education
      taught me theory, design, and evaluation of one or more arbitrary software systems.
      My internships taught me to focus on style, convention, and pragmatism. Professionally
      I focus on reliability, insight, and efficiency. My non-technical background provided
      years of leadership, interpersonal, and soft-skills training. I’m proficient
      individually and excel in close-knit, semi-autonomous teams.
